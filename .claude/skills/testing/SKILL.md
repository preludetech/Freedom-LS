# Testing

This Skill helps implement features and fix bugs using Test-Driven Development, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this Skill when:
- **Implementing new features** - Write tests first, then implement
- **Fixing bugs** - Write failing test, then fix
- **User mentions "TDD", "test", "pytest"**
- **Adding functionality** - Use TDD to design it
- **Refactoring code** - Ensure tests pass throughout
