## Brand Guidelines

### Colors

**Primary Colors:**

| Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Deep Navy | `#1E3A5F` | `rgb(30, 58, 95)` | Primary brand color. Headers, primary buttons, key UI elements |
| Bright Blue | `#3B82F6` | `rgb(59, 130, 246)` | Interactive elements, links, highlights. Conveys openness |
| Emerald | `#10B981` | `rgb(16, 185, 129)` | Success states, progress indicators, completion. Represents growth |
| Amber | `#F59E0B` | `rgb(245, 158, 11)` | Accent only. CTAs, important notices. Use sparingly |

**Neutral Colors:**

| Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Slate | `#1E293B` | `rgb(30, 41, 59)` | Body text |
| Slate | `#64748B` | `rgb(100, 116, 139)` | Secondary text, metadata |
| Light Slate | `#F1F5F9` | `rgb(241, 245, 249)` | Backgrounds, subtle containers |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | `rgb(255, 255, 255)` | Content backgrounds |

**Color Psychology:**

- Deep Navy → Trust, professionalism, foundation
- Bright Blue → Openness, possibility, tech-forward
- Emerald → Growth, learning, achievement
- Amber → Energy, excitement, attention

### Typography

**Primary Typeface: Inter**

Open-source, highly readable at all sizes, designed for screens. Aligns with open-source values.

| Element | Weight | Size |
|---------|--------|------|
| Display | SemiBold/Bold | 36-48px |
| H1 | SemiBold | 28-32px |
| H2 | SemiBold | 22-24px |
| H3 | Medium | 18-20px |
| Body | Regular | 16px |
| Small/Caption | Medium | 14px |

**Monospace: JetBrains Mono**

For code snippets, technical documentation, file paths, markdown syntax, configuration examples.

**Fallback Stack:**

```css
font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'Consolas', monospace;
```

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clear, Not Clever** | Explain simply. No jargon for its own sake |
| **Confident, Not Arrogant** | We know FreedomLS is good. Let the product speak |
| **Enabling, Not Prescriptive** | "You could do X" rather than "You should do X" |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Marketing/Website | Enthusiastic, possibility-focused |
| Documentation | Direct, helpful, thorough |
| In-App UI | Concise, supportive |
| Error Messages | Honest, solution-oriented |
| Community/GitHub | Welcoming, collaborative |

### Core Messages

1. **Freedom through flexibility**: Extend and customize without limits
2. **Learning-first design**: Built around education, not administration
3. **Open by default**: Open source platform, open content possibilities
4. **Professional quality**: Polished and production-ready from day one

## Logo Guidelines

### Logo Concept Direction (Pending Creation)

**Symbol concepts to consider:**

- Open structures (brackets, doorways, frames) suggesting extensibility
- Forward motion indicating progression or growth
- Modular forms that could connect or extend

**Wordmark treatment:**

- "FreedomLS" as single word
- "LS" optionally in lighter weight or Bright Blue
- Clean, modern sans-serif (Inter Bold or similar)
- Should work with or without symbol

**Clear space:** Minimum equals height of "F" in FreedomLS

**Minimum sizes:**

- Digital: 32px height
- Print: 0.5 inch / 12mm height

**Required variations:**

- Primary (full color on light backgrounds)
- Reversed (white on dark backgrounds)
- Monochrome (Deep Navy or black)
- Icon only (for favicons, app icons)

## What to Avoid

### Visual Don'ts

- ❌ Gradients on brand colors—keep flat and modern
- ❌ Drop shadows on text
- ❌ Logo on busy or low-contrast backgrounds
- ❌ Stretching, rotating, or distorting the logo
- ❌ Colors outside the defined palette for brand elements
- ❌ Overusing Amber—it's an accent, not primary

### Messaging Don'ts

- ❌ Disparaging other LMS platforms by name
- ❌ Using "simple" as a selling point—we're feature-rich
- ❌ Promising "unlimited" customization without noting dev work required
- ❌ Corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, disrupt)
- ❌ Being preachy about open source

### Tone Don'ts

- ❌ Being condescending to less technical users
- ❌ Overselling—genuine enthusiasm over hype
- ❌ Promising features that don't exist yet
- ❌ Using jargon without explanation for non-developers
