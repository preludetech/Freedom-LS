Look for all comments that mention @claude across the whole code base.

List all the tasks you found and ask me to confirm before starting implementation.

Implement all functionality in whatever order you see fit.

Make sure all tests pass. Follow TDD when implementing new functionality or fixing bugs.

When you have completed one of the instructions then make a git commit.

When you think you have finished all the tasks, then do another search for all comments mentioning @claude. Repeat until there is nothing left to do.
