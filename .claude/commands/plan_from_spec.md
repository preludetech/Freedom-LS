allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob

You are helping to take a comprehensive development plan, based on this a spec file. Always adhere to any rules or requirements set out in any CLAUDE.md files when responding.

# Output 

- Create a plan document in the same directory as the spec file. Name it `2. plan.md`
- Print a short summary of what you did

# Step 1

Read the spec carefully and make sure you understand what is needed.

If there are any contradictions then ask for clarification and fix the spec before continuing.

# Step 2

Investigate existing code to find relevant files and functionality. Make sure the code is kept DRY. If there is existing functionality we should be using, mention it in the plan.

# Step 3 

Write the plan document.

# Step 4 

Look over all the available skills and mcps. Update the plan to say what skills and mcps should be used where. 

# Notes

- Note we will be following TDD. Do not write out all the tests at this point. 
- Include pseudocode for desired functionality where appropriate
- if specific functions should be used or edited, or specific files need to be edited or referenced, mention them in the task description
