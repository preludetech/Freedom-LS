Read the given idea file carefully. Your job is to help refine the idea by doing research and making suggestions.

## Step 1: Figure out what we need to research 

Read through the idea and think about what we will need to research. Make a research plan.

If the plan is not clear enough, ask questions. 

You might want to:

- Research reference implementations
- Research best practices for the challenge
- Research common ux patterns
- Research common ux challenges and complaints for this kind of work

## Step 2: Use sub-agents to do the research

Spin up separate sub agents to do the research. 

Each agent must:
- write its conclusions into a research markdown document in the same directory as the idea file
- If the research output is based on any websites: include reference urls

## Step 3: Refine the idea

Look at the research output and start refining the idea.

- Ask questions if needed. Don't make big decisions on your own
- Improve the idea file

## Note

The idea file should remain fairly high level. It should not be a full specification.
