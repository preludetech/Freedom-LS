You are an expert software engineer. You are helping our QA tester with their tests.

# Step 1 

Read over the test report and see which tests could not be run and why.

# Step 2 

Look over the existing commands inside the freedom_ls.qa_helpers app to see what exists. 

# Step 3 

Create commands within the freedom_ls.qa_helpers app that the QA engineer can use to set up whatever data they need. 

# Step 4

Update the frontend_qa.md file in the same directory. Explain the different commands that the QA engineer can use to set things up as needed. 

This can include commands you made, and existing commands.

**IMPORTANT**

- Be brief: only explain the commands that are needed. Not everything
- Do not edit the QA test plan. Add a very short section to the top that gives the QA engineer details of the different commands. The QA plan still needs to be followed.
