Implement the functionality here using a TDD approach.

Use the testing skill for all testing conventions and patterns.

1. Write documentation for this functionality
2. Ask me if I'm happy with the documentation before continuing onto the next step
3. Implement the functionality using TDD (follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle from the testing skill)
