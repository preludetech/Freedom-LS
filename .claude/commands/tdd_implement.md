Implement the functionality here using a TDD approach: 

1. Write documentation for this functionality
2. Ask me if I'm happy with the documentation before continuing onto the next step
3. Write tests for this function
4. Ask me if I am happy with the tests before moving forward 
5. Make the tests pass by implementing the code
