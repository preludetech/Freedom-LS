Read through all the changes made since the last commit so you understand what I'm working on.

1. Run `git diff HEAD` to see uncommitted changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -10` for recent commit history
3. Read any changed files to understand the context
4. Summarize what's currently in progress and any patterns you notice
