Currently we are using font awesome for all icons. 

Find an icon library that is easy to install (not reliant on React or anything). Use it instead of font awesome. Remove all references to font awesome.

Create a central data structure for configuring icons. This should expose a simple data structure that specifies which icons are used for what purpose.

For example: 
- the "next" icon should always be a forward arrow
- the "deadline" icon should always be a calendar. Or it could be a clock
- open slider menu button : ?
- close slider menu button : ?


Editing this structure should update all icons used throughout the application.

Look through all uses of font awesome and all custom svg icons and replace them.

Finally, make a claude SKILL to make sure that all further work adheres to the icon setup
