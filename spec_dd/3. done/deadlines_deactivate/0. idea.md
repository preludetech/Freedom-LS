Querying deadlines from the database takes time, but not all freedom_ls implementations will need to use deadlines. It should only be queried if needed.

In all student_interface functionality that makes use of Deadlines:

Check if the deadlines are active using the setting in:
freedom_ls/student_management/config.py

If deadlines are not active then don't query them from the database. Just don't take them into account or draw them to the screen.
