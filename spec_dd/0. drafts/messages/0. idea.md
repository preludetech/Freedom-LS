Build a messaging feature. Educators and students should be able to send text messages back and forth.

# Educators

Educators can send messages to students individually. They do this by navigating to the student instance in the educator interface.

They should be able to see the message history (keep it simple, load only the latest messages, load older messages when the user scrolls up using cursor-based pagination).

- Track when messages were sent and read
- Show read receipts to the sender (e.g., checkmark icons indicating sent/read status)
- Only show read receipt on the most recent message in the conversation to keep the UI clean

Educators should be able to see when they have received new messages without needing to navigate to the student:
- Unread message count badge on a messaging nav element, updated via HTMX polling (every 30-60s, only when tab is visible)

# Students

Students can see when they have new messages (unread badge in navigation).
They can view messages and reply to conversations initiated by educators.

Students cannot initiate new conversations - only educators can start a conversation. Student-initiated messaging will be added later.

# Message UI

- Chat-style layout: sent messages right-aligned (brand color), received messages left-aligned (neutral color)
- Date separators between message groups
- Timestamps: relative for recent messages, absolute for older ones
- "New messages available" banner on active conversations (polled every 10-15s) rather than auto-injecting new messages - user clicks to load

# Implementation details

- The messaging functionality should be in a separate app (`freedom_ls.messaging`)
- The messaging app can be turned on and off using configuration (conditional `INSTALLED_APPS` based on an `ENABLE_MESSAGING` setting). Not all implementations of FreedomLS will require messaging
- Use a context processor to inject `messaging_enabled` into templates so UI elements (badges, links) can be conditionally rendered
- Don't use Django Channels for now. Use HTMX polling for updates. We will implement realtime behavior later on
- No email notifications for now. Email will be added later
- Build custom - don't use third-party messaging packages (none are well-maintained and compatible with our HTMX stack)
- Simple flat message model (sender, recipient, body, timestamps, read status) - the conversation is a query pattern, not a separate model. This is sufficient for 1-to-1 messaging
