Build a messaging feature. Educators and students should be able to sent text messages back and forth.

# Educators

Educators should be able to send messages to students individually.
They do this by navigating to the student instance in the educator interface

They should be able to see the message history (keep it simple, load only the latest messages, load older messages when the user scrolls up)
- We need to track when messages were sent and read
- indicate when messages were read

Educators should be able to see when they have received new messages without needing to navigate to the student

# Students 

Students should be able to see when they have new messages 
They should then be able to view the messages, and respond.

# Implementation details

- The messaging functionality should be in a separate app
- The messaging app can be turned on and off using configuration. Not all implementations of FreedomLS will require messaging
- Don't use Django Channels for now. We will implement realtime behavior later on
