- Educators should be able to send messages to students individually.
    - They do this by navigating to the student in the educator interface
    - They should be able to see the message history (keep it simple, load only the latest things, page to see history)
- We need to track when messages were sent and read
- indicate when messages were read
- Students need to be able to respond to messages from an educator, in a similar chatbox


The messaging app can be turned on and off using configuration
