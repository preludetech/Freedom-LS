Create a new template that will be used every time a student appears in a data table in the educator interface.

It should:
- link to the user
- have a "quick view" icon button

When the user clicks on the Quick view then a drawer will slide in on the right hand side of the screen. 

# HTMX behavior

- IMPORTANT: Load the contents of the drawer using htmx
- Try to make this work: If a student drawer is opened and closed and opened again then no new requests should need to be made. 

# Drawer behavior
- slides in from the right
- has a close button
- Does not blur or obscure the rest of the page in any way

# Drawer contents

We will add to this over time as new needs arise. For now, show basic student details.
