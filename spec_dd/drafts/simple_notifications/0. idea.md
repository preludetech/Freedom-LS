We need some basic mechanisms for creating notifications for different types of users.

We need to make something general that lives in a separate app.  freedom_ls/notifications 


Notifications need to be flexible. 
- notifications are sent to users
- they have statuses (read, unread, archived)
- they have different types 

## Notification types 

We'll use different notification types for different things. Eg we might have a specific type of notification for overdue deadlines, another for new courses, etc. Note that these are just examples. We need a flexible system. 

Different notification types can be associated with different templates so they get rendered differently. For example a "deadline approaching" notification might require a link to the specific course item that is nearly due. And "new courses" might include a link to a course details page view. 

We will need to add new types over time.

## Configuration 




Add a HIDE_NOTIFICATIONS_BELL setting. By default it should be treated as if it is False

Add a notification bell icon to the header bar, it should show the number of unread notifications. if HIDE_NOTIFICATIONS_BELL is True, then dont show the bell.

# Bell icon behavior

- If you click on it, show recent notifications in time order
- New/unread notifications should be highlighted
- The user should be able to archive notifications
