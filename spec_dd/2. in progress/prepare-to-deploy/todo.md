# SDD Todo

Checklist for taking this spec from idea to merged PR. Tick items as they are completed. See `claude_plugins/sdd/commands/README.md` for the full workflow description.

## 1. Idea

- [x] (user) Write the idea file in this directory
- [x] (cmd) Optionally run `/sdd:improve_idea` to research and refine the idea
- [ ] (user) Review the refined idea and edit as needed

## 2. Spec

- [x] (cmd) Run `/sdd:spec_from_idea` to generate the spec
- [ ] (user) Review the spec carefully and edit where needed
- [x] (cmd) Run `/sdd:spec_review` to sanity-check the spec
- [ ] (user) Address any issues raised by the review

## 3. Threat model

- [ ] (cmd) Run `/ds:threat-model` against the spec
- [ ] (user) Update the spec to close any security gaps surfaced

## 4. Plan

- [x] (cmd) Run `/sdd:plan_from_spec` to generate the implementation plan and QA plan
- [ ] (user) Review both plans and edit where needed

## 5. Plan security review

- [ ] (cmd) Run `/fls-dev:plan_security_review` to check the plan for insecure design choices before implementation
- [ ] (user) Address any concerns raised in the plan

## 6. Plan structure review

- [ ] (cmd) Run `/fls-dev:plan_structure_review` to check for new cross-app dependencies
- [ ] (user) Address any structure concerns raised in the plan

## 7. Implementation

- [x] (cmd) Run `/sdd:implement_plan` to execute the implementation plan
- [ ] (user) Spot-check the changes

## 8. Code security review

- [ ] (cmd) Run `/ds:security-review` on the pending changes
- [ ] (user) Address any issues raised

## 9. QA

- [x] (cmd) Run `/fls-dev:do_qa` to execute the QA plan (missing test data will be created automatically via the `fls-dev:qa-data-helper` agent)
- [ ] (user) Review the QA report
- [x] (user) If bugs were found, fix them using TDD (failing test first, then fix)
- [ ] (user) If QA fixes changed code significantly, re-run `/ds:security-review` and address any new issues
- [x] (user) Decide what a locked-out visitor should see: whether to point AXES_LOCKOUT_TEMPLATE at a branded FLS template or set AXES_LOCKOUT_URL, whether the page discloses the one-hour cooloff, and whether it may link to password reset given ACCOUNT_PREVENT_ENUMERATION
- [x] (user + cmd) Fix QA bug: account-lockout page is an unstyled plain-text dead end with no branding or route back (TDD — failing test first, then fix)
- [ ] (user) Raise the three deferred code-review findings with the infrastructure repo: the nested AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS trade-off under EDGE-12, whether a stalled worker should fail fls_run_housekeeping, and whether tasks orphaned in RUNNING need their own sweep (all three recorded in the spec's Open questions)

## 10. Product documentation

- [ ] (cmd) Run `/fls-dev:update_product_docs` to update docs/product/ for this feature
- [ ] (user) Review the updated documentation
