We need a panel in the educator interface that will display course progress for a cohort.

Note that a cohort can be associated with multiple cohort course registrations. Navigation must be clear and easy.

## UI

The panel will look like a table. This will be a custom panel type.

The header row(s) and first column will be frozen, the rest can scroll in the X and Y direction as needed.

- There should be one row per student
- one column per course item. If there are course parts then it should be clear what course part each column is associated with. Use 2 header rows in this case - the first showing the course part (merge the cells) and the second row will show the actual course items

The individual cells should show the status of the individual course items for that student.

## Topics

if complete: 
  show complete time
  Use a check mark to show that it is done
else if started:
  show the started time
  Use a play button to show that it was started
else:
  show that it has not been started

## Forms

If there are complete instances:
    If the form is a QUIZ:
    - show the latest mark and if it is a pass/fail
    - show how many times the user took the test

show any other useful info

## Deadlines

- any cohort level deadlines should be displayed in the header area
- any student level deadlines associated with the cohort should be displayed in the relevant cell

# Panel

You will need to make a custom "panel" for this. Then it can plug into the educator interface.
