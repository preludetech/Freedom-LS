Quiz to do 
- [ ] if they passed the quiz then: show a Next button on both the course_form_complete and course_form pages 
- [ ] if they failed the quiz: show a "try again" button 


- [ ] When the user completes the last item in a course(either a form or Topic) then there should be a "finish" button. This should take the user to a "Course Complete" page that says well done. Keep it simple. Just get the UI flow to work. 


- [ ] My courses list on home page: show if a course is in progress or complete
